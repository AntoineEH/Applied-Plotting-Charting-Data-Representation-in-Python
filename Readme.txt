Hi guys,

I used these 3 datasets to get useful information about France in the Olympics since 1960 :

https://www.kaggle.com/resulcaliskan/countries-gdps
https://www.kaggle.com/centurion1986/countries-population

I have uploaded two of these datasets (country_gdp , coutry_pop) to this repository and not athlete_events.cvs due to its large size.
you can dowload it from the link above.


The visuals made it easy to conclude that:

1- French women, who were not a very large part of the Olympics contingents earlier,
now enjoy equal representation in the olympics teams.
2- We found interesting insights by looking at the most successful sporting events for France
3- GDP impacts the number of medals won by a nation positively!
4- It is also possible to predict some sports that an athlete plays using just his
height and weight. We used a very simple K-Nearest neighbors model. This can obviously be improved upon!
